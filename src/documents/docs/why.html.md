1. The Postcard iOS app takes a heavy focus on the authoring experience and fast sharing to multiple network simultaneously.
If you enjoy sharing similar links, pictures and other content to your favorite networks such as Twitter, Facebook,
LinkedIn and Tumblr, you will love the time saved by getting it all done at once.

2. If you are a website owner or content creator, the app also offers a 'Custom Network' functionality that allows any
web server to receive content by adhering to the Postcard API Protocol. Better yet, there is already a [plugin available
for WordPress][1] that makes it an easy install for most website owners. With this power users are free to display and
distribute their content however they please. You're free to run your own personal social network.

3. Postcard also introduces the idea of **hosting** content. By setting a network as the **host** when posting messages, it
will be sent to that network first and then use the link to this content for sharing to all subsequent networks. This
gives users the ability to drive traffic where they want. Either from your website to social networks or from one social
network to another. **Content creators should recognize the potential of this tool to help drive traffic**
