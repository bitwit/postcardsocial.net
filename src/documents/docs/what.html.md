Postcard has been built around the fundamental idea of standardizing the way we use social media. The [iOS app][1] was created
with two key functions that accomplish this goal:

* It allows users to share your social content across several popular social networks at the same time.
<br />**~ Write once, share everywhere.**
* It allows users to share (and optionally host) their social content with their own websites and servers.
