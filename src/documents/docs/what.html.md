Postcard has been built around the fundamental idea of standardizing the way we use social media. The [iOS app][1] was created
with several key functions that accomplish this goal:

* It's a social media authoring tool that gives you post-by-post control of where you share the message
* It allows any prepared website to also receive the posted content
* It lets one network serve as a **'host'** and the remaining networks share a link back to that **'host'** network's content
