If you don't use WordPress for as your website framework, you can still create a functional API that communicates with
the iOS app in any language. By following the API Protocol documented below, your website can respond appropriately to
content shared with it and be stored however you like.

The Postcard Plugin for WordPress is intended to serve as an example of how one could implement this
documented API protocol. You should review it's code base for deeper hints at how you can store
and display social content using this API protocol.
