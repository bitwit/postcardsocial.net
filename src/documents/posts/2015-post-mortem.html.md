It hasn't been easy to write these words, but I have decided to discontinue the Postcard Social project. Admittedly, I've been on the verge for a while now, but I still found energy from time to time to move things forward. However, due to some sweeping new policy changes in Facebook's platform as of May 2015 I've taken the final kick in my ass necessary to admit Postcard is unsustainable. The remainder of this blog entry is dedicated to looking deeper at the adventure that it has been and some of the lessons I have learned.

### Post Mortem TDLR;
- It's over and I learned a few things
- The iOS and Android projects will be released as unmaintained open source code
- Don't cry for me; I'm already librated

### What happened?
I think I approached my product development the wrong way and the revenue and traffic after launch wasn't enough to keep it sustainable.

### Sharing the code
