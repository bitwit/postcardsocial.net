I'm excited to announce Version 1.4 of the Postcard plugin for WordPress today. There have been a large number of fixes and improvements
that I think will make many people happy.

###Better native posting

In Version 1.3 I released a new option to let people automatically create new WordPress posts whenever they uploaded social content.
Version 1.4 expands significantly on that idea by offer new levels of customization to how your new content is created.

This includes:
- Titles can be the first line of your message
- Tags and hashtags can be translated to WordPress categories and tags various ways
- Feature image can be set automatically
- Instead of a shortcode embed, posts can contain  the message, link and media directly

There have also been a significant number of improvements made to the tagging and filtering system for galleries and feeds. Videos
will now play better across all browsers and mobile phones as well!

I hope you enjoy the new improvements made and please feel welcome to reach out if you have any issues or questions at [postcard@bitwit.ca](mailto:postcard@bitwit.ca)

Cheers,

Kyle
