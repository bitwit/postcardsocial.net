I haven't written much about what's up with Postcard, but I want to keep transparent about progress.

### Android & Beyond

Right now my first order of business is an Android version of the app. It's being built in [Cordova][1] which means
I'm also working toward making this more cross-platform in general via an HTML approach.

Unfortunately, the capabilities of a 'web app' alone aren't quite enough for all of Postcard's needs. So I've been opting
to learn and program some of the Android directly in Java, it just takes a bit longer. The result will be worth it.

### WordPress

Since launch, I've worked on and improved the Postcard WordPress plugin several times and I continue to consider
WordPress an extremely important part of Postcard. However, I believe that it needs a serious overhaul in the future to become
something that is most useful to the greatest number of users. In retrospect, I feel that I didn't connect with the
WordPress community enough before developing and releasing the plugin, and I would like to do that before releasing a
version 2.0.

This will involve both talking with existing users of the plugin as well as getting closer with the WordPress community.

Which brings me to my next topic...

### Sidekick Team

I'm excited to say that I currently have the privilege of working on contract with the [Sidekick team][2]. If you aren't
familiar with Sidekick, it is an incredible WordPress plugin for client education through guided interactive
audio tutorials. Myself and one other developer are currently tasked with building the 'Composer' part of this
tool that will allow developers and agencies to build their own guided tutorials for their customizations.

Working with the Sidekick team is a fantastic opportunity to work in a startup environment highly involved in the
WordPress space and I feel the experience will be integral to getting more in touch with the community at large.

Stay tuned this summer for Sidekick Composer.

### iOS

The iOS app is very alive. I've been more focused on the Android version and customer research before implementing
too many features on a whim. It's still the app I personally user every day to send my messages and a very
important part of the puzzle. There's more coming.
