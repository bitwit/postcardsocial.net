Today I'm writing to give an update on some of the latest developments and upcoming plans for Postcard.

##What's happened so far
Since its launch, Postcard has been updated 3 times and the next update is not far behind. Most of these updates have introduced no more
than a small feature or two, plus some fixes. It is first priority to make sure that the existing functionality works as expected and without crashes.

The WordPress plugin has also received several updates and improvements including a key new feature - Auto-creating new blog posts when social content
is posted. This feature is due to be expanded even further in the near future.

Even bigger and better things are on the way, however, and that's the bulk of what I want to discuss today.

##What's ahead

###The Postcard Mantra - Do it elegantly or don't do it at all
"Do it elegantly or don't do it at all" is a belief that will be carried throughout all developments of Postcard.
Good design and simplicity are at the core of Postcard and the last thing anyone wants is poorly thought out features creeping into updates.
So I ask that you remain patient as Postcard implements features and fixes. Your requests are being heard.
Some features take longer than others, particularly when they need to fit nicely within the existing design.

With that said, let's discuss at some features in the immediate game plan as well as a couple current limitations.

###Cross Platform Support
I know many people are aching for Android and desktop support. The good news is, so am I!
This will take several months to build out but you can expect that Postcard will be rolling out to new platforms.

###Better tagging and mentioning
I've heard a number of requests related to better tagging and mentioning.
From deeper analysis of your recent twitter activity, to Facebook tags to contact book suggestions. It is on the roadmap to
make these systems more robust but will involve some wholesale changes to the way it analyzes and predicts suggestions as you type.

##Location
GPS Location features are intended to make their way into Postcard in the future.

###A more robust WordPress plugin
Since launch, many requests have been made for a wide variety of feature for the WordPress plugin. I will try and implement
as much as possible and give people adequate options to set up their feeds exactly the way they please. Everyone uses their
WordPress websites a little bit differently so it is important to consider how different themes and setups will be affected
by every new features added to the plugin.

###LinkedIn & G+ Company pages
LinkedIn and G+ company pages will be investigated in the near future. Generally, Postcard will try to support all
open social networks that allow for promptless posting.

###Not currently available - G+, Instagram, Pintrest
Many have asked about getting support for Google+ Personal Feeds, Instagram and Pintrest.
Unfortunately, at the time of writing this, these services do not allow promptless posting to their feeds. While Postcard
could implement ways of sending you to these apps and with pre-filled messages, that would not be consistent
with the elegant experience Postcard is committed to delivering.

However, I am trying to reach out to these companies to express interest.
I highly encourage you to contact these services and let them know that
you want their APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to be opened up for promptless access.

- **Google+**:

- **Pintrest**: [Submit a Request](https://help.pinterest.com/anonymous_requests/new)
- **Instagram**: Since being bought by Facebook, it appears Instagram has closed all direct support lines. If you know of a way to reach Instagram, please let me know. [Their official response is here.](http://help.instagram.com/447700568611091).
Perhaps consider leaving feedback that this response is not helpful and that you don't like the answer.

###More undisclosed features coming too
While I can't divulge every plan for Postcard in the coming months, I assure you that there are many other features on the roadmap.
You are always welcome to [reach out by email](mailto:postcard@bitwit.ca) and talk. I would love to hear from you.
